### How to sort a dirtionary in Python
It is not possible to sort a dictionary, only to get a representation of a dictionary that is sorted. Dictionaries are inherently orderless, but other types, such as lists and tuples, are not. So you need an ordered data type to represent sorted values, which will be a list—probably a list of tuples.  

For instance,  

```python
import operator  
x = {1: 2, 3: 4, 4: 3, 2: 1, 0: 0}  
sorted_x = sorted(x.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))  
```
sorted_x will be a list of tuples sorted by the second element in each tuple. dict(sorted_x) == x.

And for those wishing to sort on keys instead of values:

```python
import operator
x = {1: 2, 3: 4, 4: 3, 2: 1, 0: 0}
sorted_x = sorted(x.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(0))
```

### Naive matching
```python
def naive(p, t):
    occurrences = []
    for i in range(len(t) - len(p) + 1):  # loop over alignments
        match = True
        for j in range(len(p)):  # loop over characters
            if t[i+j] != p[j]:  # compare characters
                match = False
                break
        if match:
            occurrences.append(i)  # all chars matched; record
    return occurrences
```
Lets say y is the length of reference genome, x is the length of the reads  
The maximum number of comparison would be **x\times(y-x+1)** times  
The minimum number of comparison would be **y-x+1** times  
This algorithm tends to have number of comparisons closer to minimum
