Q1 How many alignments does the set contain?
samtools flagstat athal_wu_0_A.bam
# in total

Q2 How many alignments show the read’s mate unmapped?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut -f7 | grep "*" |wc -l

Q3 How many alignments contain a deletion (D)?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut -f6 | grep "D" |wc -l

Q4 How many alignments show the read’s mate mapped to the same chromosome?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut -f7 | grep "=" |wc -l

Q5 How many alignments are spliced?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut -f7 | grep "*" |wc -l

Q6 How many alignments does the set contain?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam "Chr3:11777000-11794000" | wc -l

Q7 How many alignments show the read’s mate unmapped?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam "Chr3:11777000-11794000" | cut -f7 | grep "*"| wc -l

Q8 How many alignments contain a deletion (D)?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam "Chr3:11777000-11794000" | cut -f6 | grep "D"| wc -l

Q9 How many alignments show the read’s mate mapped to the same chromosome?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam "Chr3:11777000-11794000" | cut -f7 | grep "="| wc -l

Q10 How many alignments are spliced?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam "Chr3:11777000-11794000" | cut -f6 | grep "N"| wc -l

Q11 How many sequences are in the genome file?
samtools view -H athal_wu_0_A.bam
# of @SQ

Q12 What is the length of the first sequence in the genome file?
LN of the first @SQ

Q13 What alignment tool was used?
ID of @PG

Q14 What is the read identifier (name) for the first alignment?
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam|head -1|cut -f1

Q15 What is the start position of this read’s mate on the genome? Give this as ‘chrom:pos’ if the read was mapped, or ‘*” if unmapped.
samtools view athal_wu_0_A.bam|head -1|cut -f7,8|grep "="|cut -f2

Q16 How many overlaps (each overlap is reported on one line) are reported?
bedtools intersect -wo -a athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf -b athal_wu_0_A.bam | wc -l

Q17 How many of these are 10 bases or longer?
bedtools intersect -wo -a athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf -b athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut -f16 | grep -c [1-9][0-9]

Q18 How many alignments overlap the annotations?
bedtools intersect -wo -a athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf -b athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut -f10-14 | sort -u | wc -l

(Multiple reads may map at the same coordinates, so the information in columns 10-12 is insufficient. The minimum information needed to define the alignments is contained in columns 10-14, which include the read ID and the flag, specifying whether this is read 1 or read 2 in a pair with the same read ID).)

Q19 Conversely, how many exons have reads mapped to them?
bedtools intersect -wo -a athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf -b athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut -f1-9 | sort -u |wc -l

Q20 If you were to convert the transcript annotations in the file “athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf” into BED format, how many BED records would be generated?
bedtools intersect -wo -a athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf -b athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut -f9 |cut -d ' ' -f1,2| sort -u | wc -l
