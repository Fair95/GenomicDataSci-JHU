Q7 How many matches (alignments) were reported for the original (full-match) setting? Exclude lines in the file containing unmapped reads.
all_aligned = 93780+43939 = 137719


Q8 How many matches (alignments) were reported with the local-match setting? Exclude lines in the file containing unmapped reads.
all_aligned = 84939+56105 = 141044

Q9 How many reads were mapped in the scenario in Question 7?
all_aligned = 93780+43939 = 137719

Q10 How many reads were mapped in the scenario in Question 8?
all_aligned = 84939+56105 = 141044

Q11 How many reads had multiple matches in the scenario in Question 7? You can find this in the bowtie2 summary; note that by default bowtie2 only reports the best match for each read.​
43939

Q12 How many reads had multiple matches in the scenario in Question 8? Use the format above. You can find this in the bowtie2 summary; note that by default bowtie2 only reports the best match for each read.​
